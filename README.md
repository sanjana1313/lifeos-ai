# LifeOS AI

LifeOS AI is a smart academic and personal load management system for students.

It helps students:
- Track academic workload (subjects, exams, assignments)
- Manage personal commitments (appointments, hobbies, health)
- Detect overload and time conflicts
- Make better daily scheduling decisions

This project was built as a hackathon prototype using Replit and GitHub.
